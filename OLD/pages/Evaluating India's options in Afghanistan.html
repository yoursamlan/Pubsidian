<h3>Background: </h3>
<p>•	On 11th September 2001, terrorists attacked America resulted in the killing of 3,000 people.<br/>
•	Osama Bin Laden, the head of Islamist terror group al-Qaeda, was identified as the man behind the attacks.<br/>
•	The Taliban, radical Islamists who ran Afghanistan back then, protected Bin Laden and refused to hand him over.<br/>
•	Eventually after 9/11, the US launched airstrikes against Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom).<br/>
•	After the attacks, the NATO coalition troops declared war on Afghanistan thus dislodging the Taliban regime and established a transitional government in Afghanistan.</p>
<h3>Reason for US Pull Back: </h3>
<p>•	US has already achieved its realistic objectives such as killing Osama bin Laden and disrupting al-Qaeda networks.<br/>
•	Besides, defeating the Taliban and Afghan nation-building was considered as the part of neoconservative ideological project which is a evident failure.<br/>
•	Preparing itself for the unfolding geopolitical contest with china is of significance in the current scenario.</p>
<h3>India and The US pull-out from Afghanistan: </h3>
<p>•	India has made huge investments and commitments ever since, which have run over 3 billion. Thus securing investments and strong economic ties is of pivotal importance.<br/>
•	To prevent Afghanistan from becoming another safe haven for anti-India terrorist groups is of pivotal importance.<br/>
•	Afghanistan becoming a safe haven for anti-India groups would disrupt the current trade routes via Afghanistan thus affecting the trade volume.</p>
<h3>India’s options: </h3>
<p>•	Thus, to safeguard its interests, India should hold talks with the Taliban to seek security guarantees in return for continued development assistance.<br/>
•	However, the Taliban’s strong relation with Pakistan should not be overlooked.<br/>
•	While talking to the Taliban to protect its interests, New Delhi should also enhance aid to Afghanistan’s legitimate government and security forces and work with other regional powers for long-term stability in the country.<br/>
•	India should also consider increasing its engagement with Iran and accelerating the works of the chabhar project which helps in creating direct access to Afghanistan bypassing Pakistan.<br/>
•	Finally, India should talk with China, with the objective of finding a political settlement and lasting stability in Afghanistan.</p>
<h3>Way forward: </h3>
<p>•	India should take a layered approach.<br/>
•	Its immediate goal should be the safety and security of its personnel and investments.<br/>
•	The long-¬term goal should be finding a political solution to the crisis.<br/>
•	India, as one of the countries that would be impacted by the consequences of American withdrawal, has to work with Eurasian powers to protect its interests and stabilize Afghanistan.</p>
