 ### What's New in Pubsidian Neo ?

*   Thank you for your support and feedback, I have added many new features as well as fixed some known bugs from the previous version.
*   Here's a comprehensive list of newly added features in this "Neo" version.

*   ![Search2.0 and Share 2.0](https://github.com/yoursamlan/pubsidian/blob/main/assets/img/Pubsidian%20NEO/s3.png?raw=true)
*   **Search 2.0**
*   *   You can now search tags with full-text support with new Search 2.0.
    *   However, in this demo, you can only search couple of tags like "primary element", "tools", etc. along with traditional file name search.
    *   Since, this example contains highly co-related data, I have decided to disable full-text search for this particular example.

*   **Share Now**
*   *   Share Now help you to share your current note with others.
    *   To share your current note, just click the "Share Current Note" button from the sidebar.
    *   It will automatically copy the URL of your current note to your clipboard.
    *   Simply send the copied URL with someone to share the note

*   ![Graph 2.0](https://github.com/yoursamlan/pubsidian/blob/main/assets/img/Pubsidian%20NEO/s5.png?raw=true)
*   **Graph 2.0**
*   *   Previously in Graph 1.0, one can only view the correlation of the notes in it. To open them, one had to go the sidebar menu.
    *   Graph 2.0 has removed this drawback. Now you can simply click on the name of the node to open them in the Content section.
    *   Also, Graph 2.0 introduces new color scheme, for better visualization.
    *   You can now also view unlimited number of nodes in Graph 2.0
    *   ![Graph 2.0](https://github.com/yoursamlan/pubsidian/blob/main/assets/img/Pubsidian%20NEO/s1.png?raw=true)

*   **CORE 2.0**
*   *   New Pubsidian CORE, namely _data2.json_ gives you the flexibility to choose the notes to list in pubsidian.
    *   To refrain a note from listing in the main mwnu, simply set the **"list"** value of the corresponding note to **false** in the _data2.json_.
    *   ![CORE 2.0](https://github.com/yoursamlan/pubsidian/blob/main/assets/img/Pubsidian%20NEO/s7.png?raw=true)
    *   You can now also add custom tag and descriptions in _data2.json_

## Features
- Completely FREE
- Fully Responsive Notes.
- Graph View for Understanding Correlation BETTER and EASIER.
- Load where you left off.
- Search your note from a larger database.

## Dependency
- Only [d3.js](https://d3js.org) for generating the Graph. Apart from that, written completely in conventional JavaScript a.k.a. vanilla JS. No other JS library is used.

## Structure

## Why this project?
- For the last couple of months, I'm using OBSIDIAN.md, a fantastic note-taking app, for tracking my studies and boosting productivity and **I LOVE IT**. But, after using for a while, yesterday, when I was about to present couple of notes to my friend, I had faced some serious challenges, publishing my notes.
- Browsing into the forum, I've come to know about Obsidian-Publish and some other alternatives. While [Obsidian publish](https://obsidian.md/publish) costs **8$ per month and works flawlessly** (which is btw a lot for the students like me with zero incomeðŸ˜¢), I have faced a hard time understanding its free alternatives. Also, all free alternatives lack the most interesting feature of OBSIDIAN, a.k.a the **Graph View**.
- That's why after 20+ hours of code and 6 cups of coffee, here's [my version](https://yoursamlan.github.io/pubsidian) of the free Obsidian Publish with **Graph View**ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³...

## Quick-start guide
This project is currently under development. I've added a single-click-convertor for pubsidian notes. Now, you can generate a web version of your obsidian notes just with a single script. Video tutorial is coming soon.

<!--
### convert2web.py ver 1.0-beta

- STEP-1: CONVERSION:
    -  **Make sure, you have installed Python 3.5 or later.**
    -  Now, **fork and download** [yoursamlan/pubsidian](https://github.com/yoursamlan/pubsidian) to your local machine.
    -  After downloading the repository, go to the ```tools``` directory.
    -  Now open command prompt/ terminal and run
        ``` pip install requirements.txt ```
    -  After installing the libraries successfully, copy ```convert2web.py``` from the tools directory to the obsidian directory, [i.e where your notes (.md) are stored.]
    -  Now open the command prompt again and run
    ``` python convert2web.py```
    -  Enter your name. It will be reflected as ```***'S NOTEBOOK``` in your pubsidian website.
    After running successfully, you'll get an ```OUTPUT``` directory, containing three elements: ```index.html```,```data.json``` and ```pages``` directory.

- STEP-2: HOSTING:
    -  Drag and drop your ```OUTPUT``` directory in [netlify]("https://app.netlify.com/drop")

Voila!! ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ your site is online.



### convert2web.py ver 1.2-beta

Updates: 
- Fixed => ![[Pasted Images]]
- Fixed => markdown-tables

For fixing the problem with pasted images, I have chosen hosting the images to [imgur](https://imgur.com/). For this purpose, you need to change couple of things in the code. If your notes don't have any offline images, you don't need these steps.

1. Go to [https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient](https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient) to register your client. After registering your application successfully, you will get a ```client_id``` and a ```client_secret```. Here we only need the ```client_id``` for uploading images to ```imgur cloud```.
2. You also need attachment path for your obsidian vault. You can view that by going Obsidian-settings >> File&Links >> Attachment Folder Path
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33586885/130024783-6c02f753-a76d-4174-8941-4224a09e18e0.png" width=60%>

**Please note**: 
    - Please use full path of the folder, something like: C:/Users/blahblah/ObsVault/attachmets/.
    - Please Use "/" instead of "\" or "\\".
    - Add "/" while closing the path.

Now, after getting ```client_id``` and ```attachment_path```, change the following two lines of code of the ```convert2web.py```

```
CLIENT_ID = "your imgur client ID, something like: 123a1bc1234567d"
base_attachment = 'Your Obsidian Attachment Folder Path (Something like: C:/Users/blah/blah/, Please Use "/" instead of "\" or "\\". Add "/" while closing the path.)'
```

Now follow the aforementioned steps for successful conversion.



    -  **Make sure, you have installed Python 3.5 or later.**
    -  Now, **fork and download** [yoursamlan/pubsidian](https://github.com/yoursamlan/pubsidian) to your local machine.
    -  After downloading the repository, go to the ```tools``` directory.
    -  Now open command prompt/ terminal and run
        ``` pip install requirements.txt ```
    -  After installing the libraries successfully, copy ```PubsidianConverter.py``` along with ```icon.ico``` and ```web``` directory from the tools directory to the obsidian directory, [i.e where your notes (.md) are stored.]
-->
## Quickstart Guide
### Pubsidian Convert GUI v1.0
- STEP-1: CONVERSION:
    -  Download [```PubsidianConverter1.0alpha.exe```](https://github.com/yoursamlan/pubsidian/releases/download/Windows/PubsidianConverter1.0alpha.exe)
    -  Copy and Paste this application to the obsidian directory, [i.e where your notes (.md) are stored.]
    -  Simply double-click to RUN ```PubsidianConverter1.0alpha.exe``` 
    -  You will see a window, something like this:
    - <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33586885/130856672-35454bcd-3386-4afb-8ba7-33cba5b96d1d.png" width="50%">
    -  Enter your name (It will be reflected as ```***'S NOTEBOOK``` in your pubsidian website) and hit ```Convert to Pubsidian```. Now, a pop up window will arrive. Select the ```Attachment folder, i.e., where the images, used inside your obsidian notes are stored``` from the pop-up window.
    - After running successfully, you'll get an ```OUTPUT``` directory, containing three elements: ```index.html```,```data.json``` and ```pages``` directory.

- STEP-2: HOSTING:
    -  Drag and drop your ```OUTPUT``` directory in [netlify](https://app.netlify.com/drop)

Voila!! ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ your site is online.
